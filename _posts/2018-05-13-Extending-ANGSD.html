description: "<p class=\"summary\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"> This project was a block course at the University of Copenhagen. The goal was to extend the open-source ANGSD program
written in C++ to include summary statistics on NGS data. Personally, the point was to learn the basics of C++ in as little time as possible,
    and to see it applied correctly. </p>. <br> <p class=\"summary\"  style=\"text-align: right; font-size:0.75vw;\"> * background figure is the analytical machine devised by Charles Babbage in 1840 </p>"

<p class="description"> I had no knowledge of low level programming (after a year and a half of pure Python and R) before starting this project.
    The program itself was written in a highly modular way to allow secure multithreading and chunking, and I had
two months to learn C++, learn how the program works, its components and how they function and then modify it to make it work the way I want to without breaking it.I
    went through what amounted to 10 chapters of <em>"The C++ Programming Language"</em> book by Bjarne Stroustrupâ€Ž to cover classes/objects, pointers,
references, constructors and destructors and then I got to work. The project was finished successfuly and it allowed me to start learning assembly language,
    and computer systems on my own through CMU's book, <em>"Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"</em> by Randal E. Bryant.
